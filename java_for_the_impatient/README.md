# Java for the Impatient Exercise Repo

This is a repository to keep track of notes and code as I work
through Java for the Impatient by Cary S. Horstmann.

## Java Installation/Setup
### ArchLinux
* All installation information found 
  [here] (https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/java), though the latest
  Java should be installed by default.
* Check OpenJDK version: `$ java -version`
* Check current/available JVMs: `$ archlinux-java status`
