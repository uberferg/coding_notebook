# The Notebook

## Using The Notebook
The Notebook is organized by date. Directories exist for months and years,
and a page is created for each day as needed. A script is included to easily
open today's page, and automatically create the needed files and directories
as needed.

To open and edit today's page, run:
```
./newpage
```

Alternatively, start the notebook server by running the following command from _this_ directory:
```
jupyter notebook
```

In either case, the server will start on `http://localhost:8888`.


### Dependencies
_Requires Jupyter installation to use_. JupyterNotebook is included in the Anaconda scientific Python distribution.

Download the the official anaconda3 Installer:

https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux

Run the installer. *Use the `bash` command regardless of the shell you are using.*

```
bash /path/to/anaconda3installer
```

Verify the Anaconda installation by by running `anaconda-navigator` from a terminal.
