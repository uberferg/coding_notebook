    "- resistors still cause all results to fail, not sure why. might just be too little current to produce a strong magnetic field in the solenoid? might just be burning out the resistors immediately and butting the circuit (definitely burned out at least 2)\n",
    "- main issue appears to be making a decent dial. haven't been abel to produce a low-friction axis of rotation for the dials I've tried, so the best results so far have just been making the \"dial\" loose enough to flip completely in 1 direction or a another (aka says which way current is flowing, but is loose enough that any current over some threshold causes identical measurement, and everything below it causes nothing)."
